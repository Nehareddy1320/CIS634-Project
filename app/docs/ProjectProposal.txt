Project Proposal
Name of the project: Food Wastage Management.
Technologies: Java, XML
Database: Microsoft SQL
Description:
	The main goal of this application is to help in reducing wastage of food.
	This application has 2 logins. One is as admin and other is as a regular user.
	This application has registration page, login page and main page.
	Users can register and login with a unique username.
	An inbuilt username and password will be given to the admin.
	There will be only one admin for this application.
	There will be 2 homepages. One for the users – to request food, other is for the admin – access the requests and approves it.
	Admin will have all the authorities like approving a request, cancelling a request, and modifying a request.
	Users can only create a request.
Working:
	Once the user creates a request, the admin checks the app by logging in with his/her admin details.
	This checking can happen once or twice a day based on the number of requests.
	As soon a user requests for the food to be collected, an email will be sent to both user and admin.
	A confirmation email will be sent to user saying that the request is confirmed.
	A mail will be sent to admin with the request details and the number of that request for that particular day.
