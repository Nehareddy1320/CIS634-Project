1.0 Introduction
This section provides an overview of the entire requirement document. This document describes all data, functional and behavioral requirements for software.
 1.1 Goals and objectives
There is a lot of food wastage which happens on a regular basis via parties, events or gatherings. The main goal of this project is to help save food from getting wasted.
 1.2 Statement of scope
This project delivers a working application based on android which provides a user-friendly UI satisfying all the requirements and goals.
 1.3 Software context
This project uses android studio application for development. This project uses android studio application for development. 
We used object box software and programmed in java db for database. For testing, we plan to use MSSQL, and android studio installed. The background coding is done using Java and JavaScript.
 1.4 Major constraints
This application is only compatible with android devices. It doesn’t work on IOS systems.
 2.0 Usage scenario
This section gives a detailed information of usage scenario for the software. It organized information collected during requirements elicitation into use-cases.
 2.1 User profiles
The user can be anyone. 
 2.2 Use-cases
•	Firstly, user’s sign-up / login to the application using the credentials.
If a user has an existing account,then user goes to sign in page.
•	Validations performed while sign up/login phase:
o	Username has a character length limit. Username should contain a maximum of 50 letters. Username field will only accept letters and not numbers.
o Username must contain special characters.
o	E-mail address will be validated following rules.
o	Username should be unique and should not match with any other.
o	Password cannot be less than 5 characters and more than 12 characters.
o	Username, e-mail, password fields are required to sign up.
o	For login Username and password are required.
o	All the fields are mandatory.
Login-page:
                The users who already have an account can directly login using the login page.
•	Validation made during login:
o	Username is verified from the database. Account holders’ information is already recorded in the database. Validation can be done from there.
o	When password is entered, it is matched with the data already present and is then validated.
o	Username and password fields are mandatory and can’t be blank.
Forgot password:
•	If a user forgets his/her password, the password can be retrieved from the attached e-mail.
•	A password reset link will be sent to the email upon request.

User’s functions:
o	When a user registers and logins to the application, it shows a page as Report Potential food wastage.
o	Once added the details, when clicked on add, it displays welcome user page.
o	It displays the status as pending, cancelled or accepted.

•	Admin functions:
When a user raises a request, the admin logins with his inbuilt username and password and accepts or cancel the request.
The acceptance of request is first come first serve.

 2.3 Special usage considerations
N/A
 3.0 Data Model and Description
Information domain of the software is:
 
 3.1.1 Data objects
Stored procedures and SQL tables are used for data objects.
 3.1.2 Relationships
We use primary key, foreign key constraints to show that the database tables are linked to each other.
 3.1.3 Complete data model
For the software an Entity relationship diagram is developed.
 3.1.4 Data dictionary
Will be provided in next version.
4.0 Functional Model and Description
A description of each major software function and software interface is presented.
4.1. Description of Major Functions
In our project, each requirement is uniquely represented. 
4.1.1 Requirement 1  
•	Firstly, user’s sign-up / login to the application using the credentials.
•	Validations performed while sign up/login phase:
o	Username has a character length limit. Username should contain a maximum of 50 letters. Username field will only accept letters and not numbers, special characters. 
o	E-mail address will be validated following rules.
o	Username should be unique and should not match with any other.
o	Password cannot be less than 5 characters and more than 12 characters.
o	Username, e-mail, password fields are required to sign up.
o	For login Username and password are required.
o	All the fields are mandatory. 
4.1.2 Requirement 2
During login,
•	Users can login using Login page:
•	The details provided are validated by using the stored data from the database.
•	Username and passwords are stored in the database for the users who already hold an account with the application.
While a new user signup, all the details provided by the user are stored in the data base using admin details.
          4.1.3 Requirement 3
•	Users can retrieve their forgotten passwords via provided email using “forgot password” functionality.
•	An email should be sent to the users with the password details.
4.1.4 Requirement 4
When a user raises a request of food donation, that request is sent to all the participating NGO’s so that anyone can accept the request and contact the person to receive the food
The acceptance of request is first come first serve.
